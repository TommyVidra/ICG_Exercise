# ICG_Exercise

This are my solutions for ICG exercises (INTERACTIVE COMPUTER GRAPHICS), using openGL

1: In the first exercise there were several tasks
    
    1) -To implement vectors, and 3x3 matrixes, values were given by us in the assignment.
       -Then to implement an code which wolud solve 3 equations with 3 variables
       -Finally to determine barycentric coordinates from coordinates A, B, C, which were vertices of an triangle, and from another point T
     
    2) -Using the Bresenham procedure, we needed to create an line, which coordinates were given by the user
       -After that, we needed to compare the difference in results bettwen the Bresenham procedure and an ordinary line
