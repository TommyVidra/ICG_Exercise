# ICG_Exercise

This are my solutions for ICG exercises (INTERACTIVE COMPUTER GRAPHICS), using openGL

1: In the first exercise there were several tasks
    
    1) -To implement vectors, and 3x3 matrixes, values were given by us in the assignment.
       -Then to implement an code which wolud solve 3 equations with 3 variables
       -Finally to determine barycentric coordinates from coordinates A, B, C, which were vertices of an triangle, and from another point T
     
    2) -Using the Bresenham procedure, we needed to create an line, which coordinates were given by the user
       -After that, we needed to compare the difference in results bettwen the Bresenham procedure and an ordinary line
     
2: The second exercise 
    
    1) - Task was to create an polygon with n-points 
            I solved this task by asking the user to 'click' multiple times in the window, those were the points of an polygon
       - Then we had to see if an random point is inside of the polygon
       - Finnaly we had to color the polygon
            Here i had a diffrent approach and asked the user to put in 3 random numbers, which were color values. With that color i filled the polygon
            
     2) - We were given 13 .obj files which contain coordinate of different objects we had to read the coordinates of an random file and draw that object. 
            My approach was to give an user posibility to color the object or have it in one color
            The main issue I hade with this exercise was the scaling and positioning of the given object
